                <h3>Reflection on Lecture Slides</h3>
                <p>In the lecture we spoke about interaction design and interface. The interface is what stands  between the user and the system. But what is the system, who is a part of the system etc? In the  lecture slides a ‘system’ is referred to as the interval workings and the external view or in other  words the game state and the game view. This must be made visible to the actor. This concept  made a lot of sense to me as we have explored this concept in other game design courses before.  The ‘actor’ in the system is the active body within the system, for example, the user or player who  observes the representation of the system. In the system there will be ‘something that is acted  upon’ by the actor, for example, WASD keys or simply a hyperlink. This thing must be visible to  the actor. The ‘action’ or ‘interaction’ is responsive, not random, non-trivial and will modify your text in some way, for example pressing or clicking. All of these factors will result in a ‘change in  the system’ that can either be internal or external. This extensive explanation of an interactive  system gave me a lot more knowledge on how my website will work in the future. Understanding  the system is essential in order to create an engaging and useful website.</p>
                <p>As mentioned before the interface is what stands between the user and the system. It is the  symbolic representation of the meeting place between the actor (active body) and that which it  can affect. It enables and embodies the potential interaction. The system and the interface  embody the factors of interaction design. They go hand in hand with one another and both need  to work coherently. When designing a website one can use the interface to represent the system  and drive the interaction they want. The interface becomes a very powerful tool in guiding the  player to do what you want them to do whilst traversing your website.</p>
                <p>The semiotic system is a system of signs that convey meaning. This system relies heavily on signs which are made up of the ‘signifier’ and the ‘signified.’ What is an example of a sign? The sign  would be the interface element for example a hyperlink, or button. The sign is made up of a  signifier which is the thing the user (actor in the system) sees for example the text or icon. The  sign is also made up of the signified which is what the sign does for example the hyperlink  navigates the user to a URL. Designing an interface requires you to design things in a way that will  represent and control the interactions that take place within the system.</p>
                <p>Interaction Design (IxD) can be broken down into three sections namely the Information  Architecture (IA), User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI). IA includes organising and labelling  the content to make the website usable and understandable. UX is concerned with how the users  feel when they interact with the design. UI looks at the visual appeal of the website and the  interactivity behind it. All three of these factors overlap with one another and need to work well  with each other in order to achieve a successful interactive design of a website.</p>
                
                <h3>Reflection on Video Lecture</h3>
                <p>Document Object Model Tree describes the content of the document. Below is an example of a  DOM tree. The tree provides more information to the bots. In the lecture Lucky talks about the main rendering flow that happens when you translate the code  into a website.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parsing HTML to construct the DOM tree</li>
                    <li>Render tree construction</li>
                    <li>Layout of the render tree</li>
                    <li>Painting the render tree</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I think it is important to understand this flow as it gives you a clearer understanding of what goes on when creating a website.</p>
                <p>In the lecture Lucky talks about what HTML stands for. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. These definitions come straight from the lecture. HTML usually uses Head and Body within it.</p>
                <p>So what is Semantic? Semantics refers to the correct interpretation of a word or sentence. This is a really interesting word. I have never heard of this word and so it was interesting to be learning about linguistics in our Interactive Media class. Semantic Markup is the standardisation of using the correct HTML elements according to their intended purpose. IT is important for the coder to correctly understand HTML elements in order to use them correctly in their code. Semantic markup requires the separation of content and presentation. The content needs to be correctly used in order for the intended presentation to be successful. Even if the presentation looks visually correct, the code can still sometimes be wrong.</p>
                <p>Some examples of non-semantic HTML tags:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>div</li>
                    <li>span</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is important to understand the difference between head and header. The head tag has information (meta data) about the website for example the language it is written in and where it should get its styling and Javascript code from. A header is a title for the site and/or content.</p>
                <p>In the lecture Lucky asked the class when it would be appropriate to use an article tag and when to use a section tag. I did some additional research and found a really good <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/article-vs-section/493173">website</a> that I think describes this difference well. An article is for standalone content, and a section is for grouping thematically related content. They can be used within each other, as needed. For example, if a book is the article , then each chapter is a section . When there's no relationship between groups of content, then use a div.</p>
                <p>One of the given resources was on the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section/">Smashing Magazine</a>Smashing Magazine that compares the differences between the article tag and section tag. In the article Bruce Lawson explores the semantic markup of article vs section. In the article he discusses that the section tag makes the text appear in a logical hierarchy however it is purely visual and does not communicate well with assistive technologies. Blind users may use assistive technology to understand your website. If the code is not written in a way that relates to the visual aspect as well as the intention, the user will not fully grasp the content. In this article I learnt it is important to use main, header, footer and nav tags as it can be very useful to people who use assistive technologies.</p>
                <p>When you put an image into your website, you should always have an alt text. An alt text describes the image so that if the image for some reason cannot load, the user is then able to read the descriptive text and get a better understanding of the content that was intended on being displayed. This would also help with assistive technologies. In the lecture Lucky talks about ‘accessibility’ and says that we sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that we need to design things to be accessible for people with disabilities, yet this is not always the case. If someone needs to design a website for our South African government, that website needs to be accessible to most of the public. What I mean by this is that people who only have access to a basic cell phone need to be able to access the website just as easily as someone accessing it from a laptop. Therefore the site needs to be able to work well on all kinds of devices. Some people have limited access to the internet and data. This also needs to be taken into consideration when writing the code to ensure that the website consumes as little data as possible. This is why it is important to be aware of the impact of your designs.</p>
                <p>In the lecture, Lucky explains that the URL can either have http or https in the front of it. The difference between these two is that https meant the site is secure whereas http is not secure. If the site requires the user to enter a password the site will usually be secure.</p>
