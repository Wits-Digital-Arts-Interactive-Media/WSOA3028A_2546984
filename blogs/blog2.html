                <h3>Analysis of Reading</h3>
                <p>Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’ focusses on the historical context and theoretical foundations of hypertext. Moulthrop particularly focuses on Theodor Holm Nelson’s work as well as Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of Media.” The article traces back to the roots of hypertext in the form of Vannevar Bush’s “Memex.” In this article he argues that hypertext was not well known, however as referred to in my “<a href="blog1.html">Blog Post 1</a>”, Bush discusses the concept of hypertext very extensively. </p>
                <p>Before I go further in my reflection of this article,  I would like to define what hypertext is. Hypertext is text which contains links to other text.</p>
                <p>Nelson is a theorist who coined the term ‘hypertext’ in the 1960’s. Nelson envisioned a network system called ‘Xanadu’ that predates yet foreshadows the internet we are familiar with today. Moulthrop mentions that everyone anticipated a ‘revolution’ in technology yet there wasn’t much change in the way we retrieve and understand information. In exploring the political and social impacts of hypertext and other information-sharing systems, Moulthrop consistently circles back to the definition and anticipated outcomes of revolution, drawing comparisons and contrasts throughout the discussion.</p>
                <p>The "Laws of Media" ask important questions about how inventions change things. Moulthrop uses these questions to study hypertext, looking at how it improves and replaces old elements, brings back old content, and what happens when pushed to its limits. Moulthrop focuses on the social and political impacts from a postmodern perspective, sometimes using Xanadu as an example.</p>
                <p>In the conclusion, Moulthrop revisits the initial question: "Do we really want a revolution?" He examines the political climate, noting conservatism and economic pressures but maintains a cautious yet hopeful perspective.</p>
            
                <h3>Reflection on Lecture Slides</h3>
                <p>This week’s lectures have given me a really good understanding of interaction and the WWW. From the slides I now understand that something is interactive if it is responsive, does not completely control, is not completely controlled and does not respond in a completely random fashion, according to Aaron Smuts. In the lecture I remember us talking about how as soon as something becomes digital, it can be altered which means it automatically becomes ‘interactive.’ I found this really interesting as it poses the question of whether something can be non-interactive and then become interactive when it becomes digital. I suppose a physical photograph is not responsive per se, however when it becomes digitalised, one can edit this photo making it interactable. </p>
                <p>In the lecture slides the term ‘ergodic’ is explored. In my understanding ergodic literature includes texts that require non trivial effort (like clicking or typing) to allow the reader to traverse through the text. This definition comes from Espen Aarseth; Cybertext:Perspectives on Ergodic Literature. Clicking and typing is different to that of turning a page in a book. Turning the pages of the book does not change the text in any way (not responsive), whereas clicking or typing digitally can change the text or content (responsive). This defines the difference between a trivial and non trivial action respectively. </p>
                <p>In the slides hypermedia is defined as “to operate above, or outside, of the confines of traditional analogue media constraints.” I also did some research on hypermedia and found a definition I really like which is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia">Wikipedia</a>: “Hypermedia, an extension of the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>, is a nonlinear medium of information that includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a>.” I like this definition as it reinforces Borges and Bush’s theories of having an associative tree of connections and links. It provides a really good explanation of our World Wide Web as a hypermedia system. </p>
                <p>In exploring hypermedia, one needs to also explore the concept of navigation. This is how the following theorists explain it:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Borges: “Nightmare labyrinth” </li>
                    <li>Bush: “Laying out of retractable paths”</li>
                    <li>Nelson: “Navigating non-linear information”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All three of these ideas of navigation apply in our world today. The WWW requires meticulous navigational aspects to allow for it to all make sense.</p>
                <p>In the lecture we explored some non digitised examples of hyperlinking. Maria Fischer’s “Traumgedanken” really stood out for me.</p>
                <img src="../images/MF 1.jpg" alt="Image of Maria Fischer's work: thread links from word to word" title="Maria Fischer’s Work Image 1" width="300" height="225">

                <img src="../images/MF 3.jpg" alt="Image of Maria Fischer's work: thread creates patterns and shapes" title="Maria Fischer’s Work Image 3" width="300" height="225">
                <img src="../images/MF 4.png" alt="Image of Maria Fischer's work: thread links to multiple words on one page" title="Maria Fischer’s Work Image 4" width="300" height="225">
                <img src="../images/MF 5.jpg" alt="Image of Maria Fischer's work: thread creates beautiful artistic pattern" title="Maria Fischer’s Work Image 5" width="300" height="225">
                <p>Fischer’s work does not only require a huge amount of knowledge on hyperlinking and hypertexting, but also an extensive amount of skill. Her work is a perfect visual representation of a small finite amount of information on the Web. This shows us how many links are required for one single book, nevermind the entire Web. In my opinion this is a form of artwork. The way in which she has used the metaphor of navigation and brought it to life in a visually satisfying and intricate way makes it a beautiful artwork. I cannot imagine the amount of time and skill required to create such a masterpiece.</p>
                <p>Interaction is a key concept in this course as most of what we will be creating is going to be interactable. When we create our own websites, the users will need to put in inputs and expect outputs. User events like clicking, scrolling, typing etc are important because when we create our own websites we need to understand how to guide the user, direct their actions, create meaning or subvert meaning. In order to create a successful website we need to understand the primary actions users will take.</p>
            
                <h3>Reflection on Video Lecture</h3>
                <p>In the online lecture the three virtues of a programmer were mentioned according to <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?LazinessImpatienceHubris">Larry Wall</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Laziness: it makes you go to effort to reduce expenditure.</li>
                    <li>Impatience: it makes you annoyed enough to make programs that don’t just react to  needs, but anticipate them.</li>
                    <li>Hubris: the quality that makes you write programs that other people won’t want to say bad  things about.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a BEng student I think I possess a few of these qualities. When I write code I do it right the first  time so that I can be lazy in the future and reuse snippets I’ve already created. I can also be  impatient with my code however I don’t know if this is a good quality in the way Larry Wall  describes it. I think because I’m very particular when writing code I’d hope other people wouldn’t  want to say bad things about it.</p>
                <p>In the online lecture they also mentioned the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN web documents</a> page that I briefly looked  through. It seems to be a very useful resource for this course as it provides explanations and  examples of how to write the code in creating websites. I looked through the website and tried to  familiarise myself with some terms that I would possibly use in the future. </p>
                <p>The question “what is a browser?” was asked in the lecture and I found it quite difficult to provide  a definitive answer. I know Google is a browser, Firefox is a browser, but how would I linguistically  describe what a browser is? A browser has a few distinctive characteristics, for example, it has an intractable search bar, you can have multiple websites open in a browser, and it has navigation  options that can refine your search by selecting only images, videos etc. In the lecture Mike  Geyser asks the class whether the Twitter app (now called X) is a browser. This question stumped  me again. First of all, what makes something a browser and can apps be browsers? He later  explains that apps can be browsers, they’re just browsers that are refined to portray specific  content related to the app itself. Upon research, a browser is a computer program with a graphical  user interface for displaying and navigating between web pages.</p>
                <p>On the CERN website, one can see the original Tim Berners Lee website. I found it quite  interesting to see what the very first website looked like. I think it was very meaningful to see the  basic designs of how he created this associative method of linking information. It is very relevant  to be aware of the basics in order to create the kinds of websites we know today. The Web has  come a long way since this first website and that is mainly from ideas and implementations of  people like Borges, Bush, Nelson and Tim Berners Lee himself.</p>
                <p>In the online lecture they talk about “DNS lookup.” I didn’t fully grasp this concept in the lecture  and so I did some additional research to fully understand what it means. According to the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-dns#:~:text=DNS%20Definition,devices%20to%20locate%20the%20device.">Fortinet website</a>,  the Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device. Funnily enough, my boyfriend experienced a “DNS error” the other day. He lives in the  UK and was trying to access the South African Unisa website, however he continually had a “DNS  error” for some reason. He has accessed it before but for some reason he wasn’t able to access it one day. Now that I’ve learnt what a DNS lookup is and how it works, I think his error had  something to do with his IP Address. It was interesting having seen this in real life.</p>
                <p>Another thing I learnt in the online lecture was that HTML is not rigorous, meaning if you don’t  close your code correctly for instance, the browser will try its best to solve the problem. This can  be useful however, one should always try to use correct formatting when writing their code. </p>
                <p>In the lecture, sir spoke about a few other useful resources that can be found on the Ulwazi site  when we need it. I won’t go into much detail about these resources but some of them include <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> and <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>.</p>
                <p>We use the term ‘URL’ very frequently in our lives, yet most of us don’t know what it stands for,  me included. A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is an address of a given unique resource on the web. I think it’s very important and helpful to know this acronym when one day I hopefully get a  job. In the lecture they also showed us cute <a href="https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/animating-urls-with-javascript-and-emojis/">animating URLs</a> which I thought was quite cool because I had never seen something like this before.</p>

                <p>The following websites really caught my attention and all include a variety of aspects I would like to include in my portfolio website.</p>
